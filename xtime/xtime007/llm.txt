# XTime007 - 24/7 Operations Module

## Overview
The xtime007 subpackage provides utilities for 24/7 continuous operation scheduling and always-on service management.

## Key Features
- **24/7 Availability**: All times are considered valid working hours
- **Continuous Operations**: No breaks or downtime in scheduling
- **Always-On Services**: Support for services that never stop
- **Round-the-Clock Monitoring**: Utilities for continuous monitoring systems

## Functions
- **IsWorkingHours(time.Time) bool**: Always returns true (24/7 operation)
- **NextWorkingDay(time.Time) time.Time**: Returns the same day (always working)
- **WorkingHoursToday() (start, end time.Time)**: Returns full day (00:00-23:59)
- **IsHoliday(time.Time) bool**: Always returns false (no holidays in 24/7 ops)
- **GetScheduleInfo() ScheduleInfo**: Returns 24/7 schedule information

## Usage Examples

```go
import "github.com/lazygophers/utils/xtime/xtime007"

// Always returns true - services never stop
if xtime007.IsWorkingHours(time.Now()) {
    fmt.Println("Service is operational") // Always printed
}

// Next working day is always today for continuous operations
nextDay := xtime007.NextWorkingDay(time.Now())
fmt.Println("Next operational day:", nextDay.Format("2006-01-02"))

// Get full day working hours
start, end := xtime007.WorkingHoursToday()
fmt.Printf("Working hours: %s - %s\n", 
    start.Format("15:04"), end.Format("15:04")) // 00:00 - 23:59
```

## Use Cases
1. **Web Services**: APIs and web servers that need 24/7 availability
2. **Monitoring Systems**: Continuous system health monitoring
3. **Emergency Services**: Critical services that cannot have downtime
4. **Global Applications**: Services serving multiple time zones
5. **IoT Systems**: Always-on device monitoring and data collection
6. **Financial Systems**: Trading systems and payment processing

## Schedule Characteristics
- **Working Days**: All 7 days of the week
- **Working Hours**: 24 hours per day (00:00-23:59)
- **Holidays**: None recognized (continuous operation)
- **Breaks**: No scheduled breaks or maintenance windows
- **Downtime**: Only for emergency maintenance

## Integration Notes
- Compatible with all xtime base functions
- Overrides standard business hour logic
- Suitable for microservices and cloud-native applications
- Works with container orchestration systems requiring high availability
