# XTime Package - Enhanced Time Operations

## Overview
The xtime package provides enhanced time operations including specialized work schedule utilities and extended time formatting capabilities.

## Core Functions
- **ParseDuration**: Enhanced duration parsing with additional formats
- **FormatDuration**: Human-readable duration formatting
- **Now**: Get current time with timezone awareness
- **Sleep**: Enhanced sleep with context support
- **TimeRange**: Generate time ranges with intervals

## Subpackages
This package includes specialized subpackages for different work schedule contexts:

### xtime007 - 24/7 Operations
- Always-on service scheduling
- 24-hour operation utilities
- Continuous time management
- See: [xtime007/llm.txt](xtime007/llm.txt)

### xtime955 - Standard Work Schedule (9-5, 5 days)
- Business hours time management
- Weekday-only operations
- Standard office hour utilities
- See: [xtime955/llm.txt](xtime955/llm.txt)

### xtime996 - Extended Work Schedule (9-9, 6 days)
- Extended work hour management
- Six-day work week utilities
- High-intensity schedule support
- See: [xtime996/llm.txt](xtime996/llm.txt)

## Code Examples

```go
import (
    "github.com/lazygophers/utils/xtime"
    "github.com/lazygophers/utils/xtime/xtime955"
)

// Enhanced duration parsing
duration, err := xtime.ParseDuration("1h30m45s")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Human-readable formatting
formatted := xtime.FormatDuration(duration) // "1 hour 30 minutes 45 seconds"

// Business hours checking (using 955 subpackage)
now := time.Now()
if xtime955.IsWorkingHours(now) {
    fmt.Println("Currently in business hours")
}

// Next business day calculation
nextWorkDay := xtime955.NextWorkingDay(now)
```

## Time Zone Support
- Automatic timezone detection and handling
- UTC conversion utilities
- Locale-aware time formatting
- Regional work schedule support

## Dependencies
- Standard `time` package
- Locale-specific formatting libraries
- Timezone database integration

## Usage Patterns
1. **Business Logic**: Use appropriate subpackage based on work schedule
2. **Duration Handling**: Enhanced parsing and formatting for user interfaces
3. **Schedule Management**: Work hour validation and next working day calculation
4. **International Support**: Timezone-aware operations for global applications

## Performance Notes
- Efficient time calculations with minimal allocations
- Cached timezone information for repeated operations
- Optimized work schedule lookups
