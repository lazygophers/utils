## üî¨ Memory Analysis

### Allocation Patterns

1. **Zero Allocation Operations**
   - String/byte conversions in stringx
   - Circuit breaker state checks
   - Basic type conversions in candy

2. **Minimal Allocation Operations**
   - Complex type conversions
   - JSON operations with pooling
   - Cryptographic operations with buffer reuse

3. **Controlled Allocation Operations**
   - Large data structure operations
   - File I/O operations

### Memory Usage Optimization

1. **Object Pooling**
   ```go
   // Example from wait package
   var workerPool = sync.Pool{
       New: func() interface{} {
           return &Worker{}
       },
   }
   ```

2. **Memory Alignment**
   ```go
   // Example from hystrix package
   type CircuitBreaker struct {
       state    uint32  // Aligned for atomic operations
       count    uint64  // Cache line aligned
       failures uint64  // Consecutive alignment
   }
   ```

3. **Zero-Copy Operations**
   ```go
   // Example from stringx package
   func ToBytes(s string) []byte {
       return *(*[]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&s))
   }
   ```

## ‚ö° Concurrency Performance
