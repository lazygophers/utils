# Cache Selection Strategy Guide

This guide helps you choose the optimal caching algorithm for your specific use case. Each algorithm has distinct characteristics that make it suitable for different scenarios.

## Quick Decision Tree

### 1. General Purpose Applications
**Recommended: LRU or Window-TinyLFU**

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)** - Start here for most applications
  - Simple, predictable behavior
  - O(1) operations with low overhead
  - Good balance of simplicity and performance
  - **Use when**: Building general-purpose applications, simple caching needs

- **Window-TinyLFU** - Best overall hit rates
  - Combines recency (LRU) with frequency tracking
  - Excellent performance on mixed workloads
  - Higher memory overhead than LRU
  - **Use when**: Need maximum hit rates, have mixed access patterns

### 2. Frequency-Sensitive Workloads
**Recommended: LFU, TinyLFU, or Adaptive LFU**

- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**
  - Tracks exact access frequencies
  - O(log n) operations due to frequency ordering
  - Best for workloads where frequency matters more than recency
  - **Use when**: Hot data patterns, long-term frequency trends matter

- **TinyLFU**
  - Memory-efficient frequency tracking using Count-Min Sketch
  - O(1) operations with probabilistic frequency counts
  - Excellent for large caches with memory constraints
  - **Use when**: Large cache sizes, memory efficiency is critical

- **Adaptive LFU (ALFU)**
  - LFU with time-based frequency decay
  - Adapts to changing access patterns
  - Balances historical and recent frequency
  - **Use when**: Dynamic workloads, changing access patterns over time

### 3. Specialized Use Cases

- **SLRU (Segmented LRU)**
  - Two-tier architecture: probationary and protected segments
  - Resistant to cache pollution from sequential scans
  - Better than LRU for workloads with scan patterns
  - **Use when**: Database applications, scan-heavy workloads

- **LRU-K**
  - Tracks K most recent access times (typically K=2)
  - Better correlation with future access than standard LRU
  - Higher memory overhead for tracking multiple timestamps
  - **Use when**: Database buffer pools, need better prediction than LRU

- **MRU (Most Recently Used)**
  - Evicts most recently accessed items
  - Opposite behavior to LRU
  - Useful in specific scenarios where recent != likely to reuse
  - **Use when**: Sequential scan patterns, recent items unlikely to be reaccessed

- **FBR (Frequency-Based Replacement)**
  - Groups items by frequency, uses LRU within each frequency group
  - Combines frequency and recency information
  - More complex than pure LFU but can perform better
  - **Use when**: Need both frequency and recency, willing to accept complexity

### 4. Analysis and Benchmarking

- **Optimal (Belady's Algorithm)**
  - Theoretical optimal replacement policy
  - Requires future knowledge (not practical for real use)
  - Perfect for analysis and establishing performance baselines
  - **Use when**: Performance analysis, algorithm comparison, research

## Implementation Guidelines

### Starting Point
1. **Begin with LRU** for most applications
2. **Measure performance** with your actual workload
3. **Profile hit rates** and latency characteristics
4. **Consider alternatives** if LRU doesn't meet requirements

### Migration Strategy
1. **Implement consistent interface** across cache types
2. **Use feature flags** to switch algorithms safely
3. **A/B test** different algorithms with production traffic
4. **Monitor metrics** before and after migration

### Monitoring Recommendations
Track these metrics for any cache implementation:
- **Hit ratio**: Percentage of requests served from cache
- **Latency**: Average and P99 response times
- **Memory usage**: Total memory consumption
- **Eviction rate**: How often items are evicted
- **Scan ratio**: Percentage of sequential vs random access

## Advanced Considerations

### Multi-Level Caching
Consider combining algorithms:
- **L1**: Small, fast LRU cache
- **L2**: Larger TinyLFU or Window-TinyLFU cache
- **Benefits**: Faster common case, better overall hit rates

### Partitioned Caching
Split cache by data characteristics:
- **Hot data**: Frequency-based algorithms (LFU, TinyLFU)
- **Warm data**: Recency-based algorithms (LRU, SLRU)
- **Benefits**: Optimized for different access patterns

### Adaptive Selection
Implement runtime algorithm selection:
- **Monitor workload characteristics**
- **Switch algorithms based on detected patterns**
- **Use machine learning for pattern recognition**

## Common Pitfalls

### Algorithm Mismatches
- **Don't use LFU** for rapidly changing workloads
- **Don't use MRU** for typical web applications
- **Don't use simple LRU** for scan-heavy workloads

### Over-Engineering
- **Start simple** before optimizing
- **Measure before switching** algorithms
- **Consider maintenance complexity**

### Under-Provisioning
- **Cache too small**: Any algorithm performs poorly
- **Wrong capacity planning**: Monitor and adjust based on working set size
- **Ignoring memory overhead**: Account for algorithm-specific overhead

## Testing Your Choice

### Benchmark Your Workload
```go
// Example benchmark setup
func BenchmarkCacheAlgorithm(b *testing.B) {
    cache := algorithm.New[string, []byte](capacity)

    b.ResetTimer()
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        // Your specific access pattern
        cache.Get(generateKey(i))
        cache.Put(generateKey(i), generateValue(i))
    }
}
```

### Simulate Production Patterns
1. **Capture access logs** from production
2. **Replay patterns** against different algorithms
3. **Measure hit rates** and performance
4. **Choose based on real data**

## Conclusion

The choice of caching algorithm significantly impacts application performance. Start with LRU for simplicity, measure your specific workload characteristics, and migrate to more sophisticated algorithms only when justified by measurable improvements in your use case.

Remember: **the best algorithm is the one that performs well for YOUR specific access patterns and constraints**.
